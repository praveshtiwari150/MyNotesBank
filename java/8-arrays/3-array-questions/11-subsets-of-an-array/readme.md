## ðŸ§© Problem: Generate All Subsets of an Array Using Bit Manipulation

### Description

Given an array of integers, generate and print all possible subsets (also known as the power set) of the array. Each subset should be displayed on a new line, with elements separated by tabs (`\t`). If an element is not included in a particular subset, you may represent its position with a dash (`-`) or simply omit it, depending on your formatting preference.

### Input Format

- The first line contains an integer `n` â€” the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers â€” the elements of the array.

### Output Format

- Print all `2^n` subsets of the array, each on a new line.
- Each subset should display the included elements in their original order, separated by tabs (`\t`).
- For positions where elements are excluded, you may use a dash (`-`) or omit them, based on your chosen formatting.

### Constraints

- `1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10`
- `-10^9 â‰¤ arr[i] â‰¤ 10^9`

### Sample Input
```
3
1 2 3
```

### Sample Output
```
-	-	-
-	-	3
-	2	-
-	2	3
1	-	-
1	-	3
1	2	-
1	2	3
```

### Explanation

The array `[1, 2, 3]` has `2^3 = 8` possible subsets. Each subset corresponds to a binary number from `0` to `7`:

- `000`: All elements excluded â†’ `-	-	-`
- `001`: Only 3 included â†’ `-	-	3`
- `010`: Only 2 included â†’ `-	2	-`
- `011`: 2 and 3 included â†’ `-	2	3`
- `100`: Only 1 included â†’ `1	-	-`
- `101`: 1 and 3 included â†’ `1	-	3`
- `110`: 1 and 2 included â†’ `1	2	-`
- `111`: All elements included â†’ `1	2	3`

Each bit in the binary representation indicates whether to include (`1`) or exclude (`0`) the corresponding element from the array.

### Note

This problem utilizes bit manipulation to efficiently generate all subsets of a set. For each number from `0` to `2^n - 1`, its binary representation determines which elements are included in the corresponding subset. This approach is efficient and commonly used in problems involving subsets and combinations.
