Below are essential questions and answers derived directly from the content you provided about "Week 14.1 - Next.js Introduction." These focus on key concepts, features, setup, routing, layouts, server-side rendering, and client components, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of Next.js as introduced by Harkirat.

---

### **Questions and Answers**

#### **1. What is the main focus of Harkirat’s lecture in Week 14.1?**
**Answer:**  
Harkirat introduces Next.js, a React framework that simplifies server-rendered React applications. He highlights benefits like built-in server-side rendering, API routes, file-based routing, and optimizations for bundle size and static site generation, while addressing the waterfalling issue, exploring Next.js offerings, and guiding through project setup, file structure, routing, layouts, and client components.

#### **2. What prerequisites are necessary before learning Next.js 14?**
**Answer:**  
1. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Understanding the fundamentals of web development, including HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.  
2. **React Basics**: Knowledge of components, state, props, and lifecycle methods, such as creating a simple React component with state management (e.g., a counter using `useState`).

#### **3. What problems in traditional React applications does Next.js address?**
**Answer:**  
1. **Separate Backend Project for API Routes**: Next.js provides built-in API routes, eliminating the need for a separate backend.  
2. **Routing**: Next.js offers file-based routing instead of requiring third-party libraries like React Router.  
3. **SEO Optimization**: Next.js supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for better SEO, unlike client-side rendered (CSR) React apps.  
4. **Waterfalling Problem**: Next.js reduces sequential loading delays with code splitting and lazy loading.

#### **4. How does Next.js improve SEO compared to traditional React applications?**
**Answer:**  
Traditional React apps use client-side rendering (CSR), where initial HTML lacks content, making it hard for search engine crawlers to index. Next.js uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to send fully rendered HTML and Static Site Generation (SSG) to pre-render pages at build time, ensuring content is easily indexed by crawlers like Googlebot.

#### **5. What is the waterfalling problem in traditional React applications?**
**Answer:**  
In CSR React apps, the browser sequentially fetches `index.html`, the JavaScript bundle, checks user login status, and then fetches data (e.g., blog posts), causing a "waterfalling" effect with multiple round trips. This delays initial rendering and worsens user experience, especially on slow networks.

#### **6. How does Next.js mitigate the waterfalling problem?**
**Answer:**  
Next.js mitigates waterfalling with:  
- **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**: Splits code into smaller chunks loaded on-demand, reducing initial payload.  
- **SSR and SSG**: Pre-renders pages on the server or at build time, minimizing client-side fetch delays.  
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Updates static pages in the background without full rebuilds.  
- **Automatic Optimizations**: Optimizes images and script loading for efficiency.

#### **7. What additional offerings does Next.js provide over traditional React?**
**Answer:**  
- **SEO Optimization**: Via SSR and SSG.  
- **API Routes**: Built-in API handling within the app.  
- **File-based Routing**: Routes defined by file structure.  
- **Bundle Size Optimizations**: Reduces page weight automatically.  
- **Maintained by Vercel**: Regular updates and support.

#### **8. How do you bootstrap a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS?**
**Answer:**  
Run:  
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```  
Select TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, App Router, and import aliases during setup. This creates a project with `app/`, `next.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.js`, `.eslintrc.json`, and `tsconfig.json`.

#### **9. What is the initial file structure of a Next.js project?**
**Answer:**  
```
my-next-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── globals.css
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── next.config.mjs
├── postcss.config.js
├── tailwind.config.js
├── .eslintrc.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```  
The `app/` directory holds code, routes, and layouts.

#### **10. How do you configure import aliases in a Next.js project?**
**Answer:**  
In `tsconfig.json`, add:  
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./app/*"]
    }
  }
}
```  
This maps `@/` to the `app/` directory for easier imports.

#### **11. How does file-based routing work in Next.js?**
**Answer:**  
Next.js uses a file-based routing system where folders in `app/` represent route segments, and `page.tsx` files define publicly accessible routes. For example, creating `app/signup/page.tsx` makes `/signup` accessible with:  
```tsx
export default function SignUp() {
  return <div><h1>Sign Up</h1></div>;
}
```

#### **12. How does Next.js handle server-side rendering for the `/signup` route?**
**Answer:**  
Next.js renders the `SignUp` component on the server, sending fully rendered HTML to the client. Viewing the page source at `http://localhost:3000/signup` shows content like form elements, improving SEO and initial load performance compared to CSR.

#### **13. What are layouts in Next.js, and what can they do?**
**Answer:**  
Layouts define shared UI components across routes. Features include:  
- **Root Layout**: `app/layout.tsx` wraps all pages with `<html>` and `<body>`.  
- **Nested Layouts**: Sub-route layouts (e.g., `signin/layout.tsx`) wrap specific routes.  
- **Wrap Child Pages**: Use the `children` prop to include child content.  
- **Preserve State**: Maintain interactivity across navigation.  
- **Fetch Data**: Use client-side hooks like `useEffect` for data fetching.

#### **14. How do you create a nested layout for the `/signin` route?**
**Answer:**  
Create `app/signin/layout.tsx`:  
```tsx
export default function SignInLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="bg-yellow-200 py-2 text-center">
        <span className="font-bold">Login now to get 20% off</span>
      </div>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```  
This adds a banner above the `/signin` page.

#### **15. How do you merge routes like `/signup` and `/signin` using a shared layout?**
**Answer:**  
- **Approach #1: Nesting Routes**: Create `app/auth/layout.tsx` with a banner, then nest `signup/` and `signin/` under `auth/`. Routes become `/auth/signup` and `/auth/signin`.  
- **Approach #2: Parenthesized Folder**: Use `app/(shared)/layout.tsx` with `signup/` and `signin/` at the root. Routes remain `/signup` and `/signin`, ignoring `(shared)` in the URL.

#### **16. Why move the sign-in logic to a `components` directory?**
**Answer:**  
Moving sign-in logic to `components/Signin.tsx` promotes reusability and maintainability, keeping the codebase modular. The `signin/page.tsx` then imports and renders it:  
```tsx
import { Signin } from '@/components/Signin';
export default function SigninPage() {
  return <Signin />;
}
```

#### **17. Why does adding an `onClick` handler cause an error in a server component?**
**Answer:**  
Adding `onClick={() => console.log("Clicked")}` in a server component fails because server-side Node.js lacks the browser’s `console` object. Next.js renders it on the server first, causing an error until hydration occurs client-side.

#### **18. What are client components, and when should you create them?**
**Answer:**  
Client components are rendered on the client-side, marked with `'use client'`. Create them for:  
- **Browser APIs**: e.g., `window`, `localStorage`.  
- **React Hooks**: e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`.  
- **User Events**: e.g., `onClick`.  
- **Dynamic Content**: Content changing via user interaction.

#### **19. How do you convert the `Signin` component to a client component?**
**Answer:**  
Add `'use client'` and update:  
```tsx
'use client';
export function Signin() {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => console.log("User clicked on signin")}>Sign in</button>
  );
}
```  
This ensures the `onClick` handler works client-side.

#### **20. What is the general rule for using server vs. client components?**
**Answer:**  
Defer client components as much as possible, keeping most logic in server components to optimize performance by reducing client-side JavaScript. Use client components only when browser-specific features or interactivity are required.

These questions and answers cover the essentials of Next.js from your provided content, focusing on its advantages, setup, routing, layouts, SSR, and client-server component distinctions, as introduced by Harkirat.

Below are essential questions and answers derived directly from the content you provided about "Week 14.2 - Backend in Next.js." These focus on key concepts, backend capabilities, data fetching, loaders, API routes, and implementing sign-in/sign-up functionality, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of Next.js as a full-stack framework as introduced by Harkirat.

---

### **Questions and Answers**

#### **1. What is the main focus of Harkirat’s lecture in Week 14.2?**
**Answer:**  
Harkirat introduces the backend capabilities of Next.js, showcasing it as a full-stack framework. The lecture covers data fetching techniques, loaders, API routes, and implementing sign-in and sign-up functionality with both frontend and backend components.

#### **2. Why is Next.js considered a full-stack framework?**
**Answer:**  
Next.js can handle both frontend and backend code within the same codebase, allowing developers to build complete applications without separate projects. It supports API routes, server-side rendering (SSR), and direct server component communication with backend logic.

#### **3. What are the advantages of using Next.js for backend development?**
**Answer:**  
1. **Single Codebase**: Frontend and backend in one repository simplify development and code sharing.  
2. **No CORS Issues**: Same-origin requests eliminate CORS complexities.  
3. **Ease of Deployment**: Unified deployment with serverless support on platforms like Vercel.

#### **4. How is data typically fetched in traditional React applications?**
**Answer:**  
In traditional React, data fetching occurs client-side using `useEffect` and libraries like Fetch or Axios. For example:  
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/user')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setUser(data));
}, []);
```  
This fetches data after the component mounts, delaying content availability.

#### **5. How does Next.js improve data fetching over traditional React?**
**Answer:**  
Next.js supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG), fetching data on the server before rendering. For example:  
```jsx
async function getUserDetails() {
  const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/user');
  return response.data;
}
export default async function Home() {
  const userData = await getUserDetails();
  return <div>{userData.email}</div>;
}
```  
This pre-renders data, improving performance and SEO.

#### **6. How do you set up a Next.js project for data fetching with Axios?**
**Answer:**  
1. Create a project: `npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app`.  
2. Install Axios: `npm install axios`.  
3. Clean `pages/index.js` and `styles/globals.css`.  
4. Fetch data in `index.js`:  
```jsx
import axios from 'axios';
async function getUserDetails() {
  const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/api/user');
  return response.data;
}
export default async function Home() {
  const userData = await getUserDetails();
  return <div>{userData.email}</div>;
}
```

#### **7. How do you add a loader in Next.js for data fetching?**
**Answer:**  
Create a `loading.tsx` file in the same directory as your page:  
```tsx
export default function Loading() {
  return <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-32 w-32 border-t-2 border-b-2 border-gray-900"></div>;
}
```  
Next.js automatically shows this while async operations (e.g., `await getUserDetails()`) in `index.tsx` are pending.

#### **8. What are API routes in Next.js, and what benefits do they offer?**
**Answer:**  
API routes allow server-side APIs within Next.js, defined in `pages/api/`. Benefits include:  
1. **Single Repository**: Unified frontend and backend code.  
2. **Standard Features**: Handles HTTP methods like Express.js.  
3. **Direct Communication**: Server components access APIs without CORS.

#### **9. How do you create a simple API route in Next.js?**
**Answer:**  
Create `pages/api/hello.js`:  
```jsx
export default function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, world!' });
  } else {
    res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method not allowed' });
  }
}
```  
Access it at `http://localhost:3000/api/hello`.

#### **10. How do you fetch data from an API route in a Next.js server component?**
**Answer:**  
In `pages/index.js`:  
```jsx
export default async function Home() {
  const res = await fetch('/api/hello');
  const data = await res.json();
  return <div><h1>{data.message}</h1></div>;
}
```  
The server fetches and renders the data directly.

#### **11. How do you move backend logic into a Next.js app’s API route?**
**Answer:**  
1. Create `app/api/user/route.ts`:  
```tsx
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({ username: 'harkirat', email: 'harkirat@gmail.com' });
}
```  
2. Update `index.tsx`:  
```jsx
async function getUserDetails() {
  const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/api/user');
  return response.data;
}
export default async function Home() {
  const userData = await getUserDetails();
  return <div>Name: {userData.username}</div>;
}
```

#### **12. How do you create a frontend sign-up page in Next.js?**
**Answer:**  
1. Create `app/signup/page.tsx`:  
```tsx
import { Signup } from "@/components/Signup";
export default function SignUpPage() {
  return <Signup />;
}
```  
2. Create `components/Signup.tsx`:  
```tsx
'use client';
import axios from 'axios';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'; // Updated from 'next/router'
import { useState } from 'react';
export function Signup() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const router = useRouter();
  return (
    <div>
      <input onChange={e => setUsername(e.target.value)} placeholder="Username" />
      <input type="password" onChange={e => setPassword(e.target.value)} placeholder="Password" />
      <button onClick={async () => {
        await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/user', { username, password });
        router.push('/');
      }}>Sign up</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### **13. How do you create a backend route for sign-up in Next.js?**
**Answer:**  
In `app/api/user/route.ts`:  
```tsx
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const body = await req.json();
  console.log('Username:', body.username, 'Password:', body.password);
  return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Sign up successful' });
}
```  
This logs the credentials and responds with a success message.

#### **14. Why don’t loaders need a separate component in SSR scenarios?**
**Answer:**  
In SSR, the page is fully rendered on the server with fetched data before being sent to the client, so no client-side loading state is needed. A `loading.tsx` file is only necessary for slow async operations to show a fallback UI during server-side delays.

#### **15. What will be covered in the next lecture following Week 14.2?**
**Answer:**  
The next lecture will explore building full-stack Next.js applications, including integrating databases, advanced fetching techniques, using Prisma ORM, and leveraging server-side capabilities for robust, scalable, and secure applications.

These questions and answers cover the core concepts of Next.js backend capabilities from your provided content, focusing on its full-stack potential, data fetching improvements, API route implementation, and practical sign-up functionality, as introduced by Harkirat. Note: Some code examples were adjusted (e.g., `next/navigation` instead of `next/router`) to align with Next.js 14 conventions as of March 28, 2025.

Below are essential questions and answers derived directly from the content you provided about "Week 14.3 - Next.js with Databases and Server Actions." These focus on key concepts, database integration with Prisma, better fetching techniques, singleton Prisma client implementation, and Server Actions, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the material as presented by Harkirat.

---

### **Questions and Answers**

#### **1. What is the main focus of Harkirat’s lecture in Week 14.3?**
**Answer:**  
Harkirat expands on Next.js by introducing database interactions using Prisma ORM, implementing better fetching techniques, creating a singleton Prisma client instance, and exploring Server Actions for executing server-side code directly from components, building on previous lessons about SSR, API routes, and client-side interactivity.

#### **2. What topics are covered in this lecture?**
**Answer:**  
1. **Databases**: Integrating a database with Next.js using Prisma.  
2. **Better Fetching Techniques**: Efficient data fetching without unnecessary HTTP requests.  
3. **Singleton Prisma Client**: Creating a single Prisma instance to manage database connections.  
4. **Server Actions**: Executing server-side code directly from components without API routes.

#### **3. Why doesn’t Next.js include a database solution out of the box?**
**Answer:**  
Next.js focuses on providing a full-stack framework with SSR and API routes but leaves database integration to third-party tools like Prisma, allowing flexibility in choosing the database and ORM that best suit the application’s needs.

#### **4. How do you set up Prisma in a Next.js project?**
**Answer:**  
1. Install Prisma: `npm install prisma`.  
2. Initialize Prisma: `npx prisma init`.  
3. Define a model in `schema.prisma`, e.g.,:  
```prisma
model User {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  username  String  @unique
  password  String
}
```  
4. Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`, e.g., `postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db`.  
5. Migrate: `npx prisma migrate dev --name init_schema`.  
6. Generate client: `npx prisma generate`.

#### **5. How do you update the sign-up API route to use Prisma?**
**Answer:**  
In `app/api/user/route.ts`:  
```tsx
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma';
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const body = await req.json();
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: { username: body.username, password: body.password }
  });
  console.log(user.id);
  return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Signed up' });
}
```  
This creates a user in the database using Prisma.

#### **6. How do you fetch user data directly from the database in a server component?**
**Answer:**  
In `pages/index.tsx`:  
```jsx
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const client = new PrismaClient();
async function getUserDetails() {
  const user = await client.user.findFirst({});
  return { name: user?.username, email: user?.username };
}
export default async function Home() {
  const userData = await getUserDetails();
  return <div>Name: {userData?.name}</div>;
}
```  
This avoids an HTTP request by querying the database directly.

#### **7. Why is fetching data via an API route less efficient than direct database access?**
**Answer:**  
Fetching via an API route (e.g., `/api/user`) involves an HTTP round-trip from the server to itself, adding latency and overhead. Direct database access in a server component eliminates this, as the server queries the database internally, improving efficiency.

#### **8. Why is a singleton Prisma client necessary in Next.js?**
**Answer:**  
In development, `next dev` clears the Node.js cache on each run, causing hot reloading to create multiple Prisma client instances. Each instance maintains a connection pool, potentially exhausting database connections. A singleton ensures only one instance is used.

#### **9. How do you create a singleton Prisma client in Next.js?**
**Answer:**  
In `db/index.ts`:  
```tsx
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prismaClientSingleton = () => new PrismaClient();
declare global {
  var prisma: undefined | ReturnType<typeof prismaClientSingleton>;
}
const prisma = globalThis.prisma ?? prismaClientSingleton();
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalThis.prisma = prisma;
export default prisma;
```  
This reuses a single instance across the app.

#### **10. How do you use the singleton Prisma client in a server component?**
**Answer:**  
Import and use it like:  
```jsx
import prisma from '@/db';
async function getUserDetails() {
  const user = await prisma.user.findFirst({});
  return { name: user?.username, email: user?.username };
}
```

#### **11. What are Server Actions in Next.js?**
**Answer:**  
Server Actions, introduced in Next.js 13, allow executing server-side code directly from components without API routes. Marked with `'use server'`, they simplify data mutations and form handling by running on the server and returning responses to the client.

#### **12. How do you define a Server Action for sign-up?**
**Answer:**  
In `actions/user.ts`:  
```tsx
'use server';
import client from '@/db';
export async function signup(username: string, password: string) {
  const user = await client.user.create({
    data: { username, password }
  });
  console.log(user.id);
  return 'Signed up!';
}
```

#### **13. How do you update the Signup component to use a Server Action?**
**Answer:**  
In `components/Signup.tsx`:  
```tsx
'use client';
import { signup } from '@/actions/user';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { useState } from 'react';
export function Signup() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const router = useRouter();
  return (
    <div>
      <input onChange={e => setUsername(e.target.value)} placeholder="Username" />
      <input type="password" onChange={e => setPassword(e.target.value)} placeholder="Password" />
      <button onClick={async () => {
        const response = await signup(username, password);
        localStorage.setItem('token', response);
        router.push('/');
      }}>Sign up</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### **14. What are the benefits of using Server Actions?**
**Answer:**  
1. **Single Function**: Usable in client and server components.  
2. **Typed Responses**: Provides type safety like tRPC.  
3. **Form Integration**: Simplifies form submissions.  
4. **Improved Security**: Executes on the server, reducing client-side risks.  
5. **Simplified Development**: Eliminates API route boilerplate.

#### **15. How do Server Actions differ from API routes in execution?**
**Answer:**  
Server Actions execute server-side code directly invoked from components, abstracting HTTP requests, while API routes require explicit HTTP endpoints (e.g., `/api/user`). Both use HTTP under the hood, but Server Actions offer a streamlined, component-integrated approach.

These questions and answers cover the core concepts of database integration, Prisma usage, optimized fetching, singleton client management, and Server Actions from your provided content, providing a solid foundation for building full-stack Next.js applications as taught by Harkirat. Note: Some imports (e.g., `next/navigation` instead of `next/router`) were updated to align with Next.js 14 conventions as of March 28, 2025.

Below are essential questions and answers derived directly from the content you provided about "Week 16.3 - Authentication in Next.js." These focus on key concepts of authentication, JWT with localStorage, cookie-based authentication, cookie properties, CSRF mitigation with SameSite, and full-stack implementation examples, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the material as presented by Harkirat.

---

### **Questions and Answers**

#### **1. What is the main focus of Harkirat’s lecture in Week 16.3?**
**Answer:**  
Harkirat covers authentication using JWT with localStorage and cookies, explaining implementation details, cookie properties, and how the SameSite attribute mitigates CSRF attacks. The lecture concludes with a full-stack implementation example.

#### **2. What is authentication, and what are its typical steps?**
**Answer:**  
Authentication verifies a user’s identity to grant access securely. Steps include:  
1. **User Identification**: User provides a unique identifier (e.g., username).  
2. **Credential Verification**: User submits credentials (e.g., password).  
3. **Credential Validation**: System checks credentials against stored data.  
4. **Access Granted/Denied**: Access is granted if credentials match, denied otherwise.

#### **3. What are some common authentication methods?**
**Answer:**  
1. **Username and Password**: Basic credential-based method.  
2. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: One set of credentials for multiple services.  
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds extra factors like codes or biometrics.  
4. **Passwordless Authentication**: Uses alternatives like magic links or biometrics.

#### **4. How does signup work with JWT and localStorage?**
**Answer:**  
1. Client sends a POST request with registration details (e.g., username, password).  
2. Server validates and creates a user in the database.  
3. Server generates a JWT with user info (e.g., `userId`) and signs it.  
4. Server sends the JWT to the client.  
5. Client stores the JWT in localStorage.  
Example (server):  
```jsx
const token = generateJWT({ userId: newUser.id });
res.json({ token });
```

#### **5. How does signin work with JWT and localStorage?**
**Answer:**  
1. Client sends a POST request with credentials (e.g., email, password).  
2. Server verifies credentials against the database.  
3. If valid, server generates a JWT and sends it to the client.  
4. Client stores the JWT in localStorage.  
Example (server):  
```jsx
const token = generateJWT({ userId: user.id });
res.json({ token });
```

#### **6. How are authenticated requests handled with JWT and localStorage?**
**Answer:**  
1. Client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Bearer ${token}`).  
2. Server verifies the JWT and extracts user info.  
3. If valid, the request proceeds; otherwise, it returns an error.  
Example (client):  
```jsx
fetch('/protected', { headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}` } });
```

#### **7. What are cookies, and what purposes do they serve?**
**Answer:**  
Cookies are small data pieces stored by the browser, sent by websites. Purposes include:  
1. **Session Management**: Track user sessions.  
2. **Personalization**: Tailor content to user preferences.  
3. **Tracking**: Analyze browsing behavior.  
4. **Security**: Enhance security with encrypted transmission (focus for authentication).

#### **8. Why use cookies instead of localStorage for authentication?**
**Answer:**  
Cookies are automatically sent with every request by the browser, unlike localStorage, which requires manual inclusion in headers. This is key in frameworks like Next.js for seamless authentication. Example:  
```jsx
fetch('/send-money', { credentials: 'include' });
```

#### **9. How does signup work with cookies?**
**Answer:**  
1. Client sends a POST request with registration details.  
2. Server creates a user and generates a session ID/token.  
3. Server sets a cookie with the session ID in the response.  
4. Browser stores the cookie.  
Example (server):  
```jsx
res.cookie('sessionId', sessionId, { httpOnly: true, secure: true });
res.json({ message: 'User registered' });
```

#### **10. How does signin work with cookies?**
**Answer:**  
1. Client sends a POST request with credentials.  
2. Server verifies credentials and generates a session ID/token.  
3. Server sets a cookie with the session ID.  
4. Browser updates/creates the cookie.  
Example (server):  
```jsx
res.cookie('sessionId', sessionId, { httpOnly: true, secure: true });
res.json({ message: 'Signed in' });
```

#### **11. How are authenticated endpoints handled with cookies?**
**Answer:**  
1. Client sends a request; browser includes the cookie automatically.  
2. Server extracts and verifies the session ID from the cookie.  
3. If valid, the request proceeds; otherwise, it returns an error.  
Example (server):  
```jsx
const sessionId = req.cookies.sessionId;
if (!session) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
```

#### **12. What are the types of cookies?**
**Answer:**  
1. **Persistent Cookies**: Stored until expiration or manual deletion.  
2. **Session Cookies**: Deleted when the browser closes, used for temporary data.

#### **13. What are the key properties of cookies?**
**Answer:**  
1. **Secure**: Sent only over HTTPS.  
2. **HttpOnly**: Inaccessible to JavaScript, mitigating XSS.  
3. **SameSite**: Controls cross-site request behavior (`Strict`, `Lax`, `None`).  
4. **Domain**: Specifies valid domains for the cookie.

#### **14. How does the SameSite attribute mitigate CSRF attacks?**
**Answer:**  
- **SameSite: Strict**: Only same-origin requests include the cookie, blocking all cross-site CSRF.  
- **SameSite: Lax**: Allows cookies in top-level navigation/GET requests, blocking POST-based CSRF but vulnerable to GET-based attacks.  
- **SameSite: None**: Sends cookies in all cross-site requests, vulnerable to CSRF unless paired with other defenses.

#### **15. What is a CSRF attack, and why was it a problem before SameSite?**
**Answer:**  
A CSRF attack tricks a user into sending unintended requests to a site where they’re authenticated, exploiting automatic cookie inclusion. Before SameSite, cookies were sent with all cross-site requests, enabling attackers to misuse authenticated sessions.

#### **16. How do you implement a backend signin endpoint with cookies in Express?**
**Answer:**  
In `index.ts`:  
```jsx
app.post('/signin', (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  const token = jwt.sign({ id: 1 }, 'secret');
  res.cookie('token', token, { httpOnly: true, secure: true });
  res.send('Logged in!');
});
```

#### **17. How do you implement a protected route with cookies in Express?**
**Answer:**  
```jsx
app.get('/user', (req, res) => {
  const token = req.cookies.token;
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'secret');
  res.send({ userId: decoded.id });
});
```

#### **18. How do you implement a frontend signin page in React with cookies?**
**Answer:**  
In `Signin.jsx`:  
```jsx
export const Signin = () => {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  return (
    <div>
      <input onChange={e => setUsername(e.target.value)} placeholder="username" />
      <input type="password" onChange={e => setPassword(e.target.value)} placeholder="password" />
      <button onClick={async () => {
        await axios.post(`${BACKEND_URL}/signin`, { username, password }, { withCredentials: true });
        alert('Logged in');
      }}>Submit</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### **19. How do you fetch user data in React with cookie-based auth?**
**Answer:**  
In `User.jsx`:  
```jsx
export const User = () => {
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState();
  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get(`${BACKEND_URL}/user`, { withCredentials: true })
      .then(res => setUserData(res.data));
  }, []);
  return <div>Your id is {userData?.userId}</div>;
};
```

#### **20. How do you serve a frontend from an Express backend with cookies?**
**Answer:**  
1. Add `index.html` in `src/` with login/logout logic.  
2. Serve it via:  
```jsx
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../src/index.html')));
```  
3. Remove `credentials` from CORS: `app.use(cors());`.

Note: Some code was simplified or adjusted (e.g., `next/navigation` usage) to align with modern conventions as of March 28, 2025.

Below are essential questions and answers derived directly from the content you provided about "Week 16.4 - NextAuth.js in Next.js." These focus on key concepts of NextAuth.js, its rationale, catch-all routes, OAuth providers (Google and GitHub), custom credential providers, and custom sign-in pages, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the material as presented by Harkirat.

---

### **Questions and Answers**

#### **1. What is the main focus of Harkirat’s lecture in Week 16.4?**
**Answer:**  
Harkirat covers NextAuth.js, a library for authentication in Next.js apps, explaining why to use it, setting up catch-all routes, adding OAuth providers (Google and GitHub), implementing custom credential providers, and creating custom sign-in pages.

#### **2. What is NextAuth.js?**
**Answer:**  
NextAuth.js is a popular authentication library designed for Next.js applications, providing a comprehensive solution for user sign-in, sign-up, and session management with support for various authentication providers.

#### **3. Can you implement authentication in Next.js without NextAuth.js?**
**Answer:**  
Yes, you can manually handle authentication using cookies, JWTs, or other methods, managing sessions and providers yourself. However, this requires more effort and careful security implementation.

#### **4. Why should you use NextAuth.js instead of implementing authentication manually?**
**Answer:**  
NextAuth.js simplifies authentication by offering a secure, well-structured approach, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and saving development time compared to manually handling sessions, cookies, and providers.

#### **5. What are some popular authentication alternatives to NextAuth.js?**
**Answer:**  
1. **Auth0**: Comprehensive identity management with social logins and enterprise features.  
2. **Clerk**: User management with flexible APIs and UI components.  
3. **Firebase Authentication**: Part of Google’s Firebase, supporting multiple methods.  
4. **In-house with Cookies**: Custom session management using cookies.

#### **6. Why is JWT with localStorage less suitable for Next.js compared to Express apps?**
**Answer:**  
In Express apps, JWT with localStorage works well as the client and server are separate, requiring explicit token inclusion. In Next.js, SSR and API routes run on the server, needing authentication data (e.g., via cookies) accessible server-side, which localStorage cannot provide due to its client-side nature.

#### **7. How does Next.js leverage cookies over JWT with localStorage?**
**Answer:**  
Next.js uses cookies, which are automatically sent with requests, enabling seamless SSR and API route authentication without manual header management, unlike JWT in localStorage, which complicates SSR.

#### **8. What types of providers does NextAuth.js support?**
**Answer:**  
1. **OAuth Providers**: Social logins (e.g., Google, GitHub).  
2. **Email Provider**: Passwordless login via email OTP or magic links.  
3. **Credentials Provider**: Custom strategies (e.g., email/password).

#### **9. How do you set up a catch-all route for NextAuth.js in Next.js?**
**Answer:**  
Create `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`:  
```tsx
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
const handler = NextAuth({ /* config */ });
export { handler as GET, handler as POST };
```  
The `[...nextauth]` syntax handles all `/api/auth/*` routes (e.g., `/api/auth/signin`).

#### **10. How do you add a Google OAuth provider with NextAuth.js?**

      },
      async authorize(credentials) {
        return { id: 'user1', name: 'test' }; // Custom logic here
      }
    })
  ],
  secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET
});
```

#### **13. How do you set up NextAuth.js environment variables?**
**Answer:**  
In `.env`:  
```plaintext
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

#### **14. How do you create a custom sign-in page with NextAuth.js?**
**Answer:**  
In `app/signin/page.tsx`:

Below is a set of questions and answers derived directly from the content you provided for **Week 19.0.1: Middlewares in Next.js**. These focus on the critical topics of middleware definition, purpose, implementation, and selective execution in Next.js, ensuring all answers are sourced from the lecture notes without adding external information.

---

### Questions and Answers on Middlewares

**Q1: What are middlewares in Next.js?**  
**A1:** Middlewares in Next.js are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the `next` middleware function in the request-response cycle. They perform tasks like logging, parsing request bodies, and adding response headers.

---

**Q2: What are common uses of middlewares in Next.js?**  
**A2:** Common uses include:  
1. **Analytics:** Tracking request details like method and URL.  
2. **Authentication:** Verifying users via tokens or credentials.  
3. **Redirecting the User:** Redirecting based on conditions like authentication status.

---

**Q3: How does the request counter middleware example work?**  
**A3:** In the example:  
```jsx
let requestCount = 0;
app.use(function middleware(req, res, next) {
  requestCount++;
  next();
});
```
The middleware increments `requestCount` for every request and calls `next()` to pass control to the next handler. The `/requestCount` route returns the current `requestCount`.

---

**Q4: How does the authentication middleware example verify users?**  
**A4:** In the example:  
```jsx
async function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization.split(" ")[1];
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, "secret");
  if (decoded) next();
  else res.status(401).send("Unauthorised");
}
```
It extracts a JWT from the `Authorization` header, verifies it with `jwt.verify`, and calls `next()` if valid or sends a 401 response if invalid.

---

### Questions and Answers on Middlewares + Next

**Q5: What are the ways middlewares can modify responses in Next.js?**  
**A5:** Middlewares can:  
1. **Rewrite:** Change the request path to another route.  
2. **Redirect:** Send users to different routes based on conditions.  
3. **Modify Headers:** Alter request or response headers.  
4. **Respond Directly:** Send a response without involving the page or API route.

---

**Q6: What are some use cases for middlewares in Next.js?**  
**A6:** Use cases include:  
1. **Authentication and Authorization:** Checking tokens or roles.  
2. **Logging and Analytics:** Capturing request data.  
3. **Server-Side Redirects:** Redirecting based on locale or status.  
4. **Caching:** Implementing server-side caching strategies.

---

### Questions and Answers on Creating a Request Counter Middleware

**Q7: What are the steps to create a request counter middleware in Next.js?**  
**A7:**  
1. Bootstrap a Next.js app with `npx create-next-app request-count-middleware`.  
2. Create `middleware.ts` in the root folder.  
3. Add code to track requests (e.g., increment `requestCount` and log it).  
4. Run `npm run dev` and visit `http://localhost:3000` to test.

---

**Q8: How does the request counter middleware track requests in `middleware.ts`?**  
**A8:** In `middleware.ts`:  
```tsx
let requestCount = 0;
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  requestCount++;
  console.log("number of requests is " + requestCount);
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```
It increments `requestCount` for each request, logs it, and calls `NextResponse.next()` to continue processing.

---

**Q9: What role does the `config` object play in the request counter middleware?**  
**A9:** The `config` object with `matcher: '/:path*'` configures the middleware to run for all routes in the application, ensuring every request triggers the counter.

---

### Questions and Answers on Modifying Request Counter

**Q10: How is the request counter middleware modified to track only `/api` requests?**  
**A10:** The middleware is updated to:  
```tsx
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/api')) {
    requestCount++;
    console.log("number of requests is " + requestCount);
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
}
export const config = { matcher: '/api/:path*' };
```
It checks if the path starts with `/api` before incrementing and updates `matcher` to `/api/:path*`.

---

**Q11: What does the dummy API route do in the modified request counter example?**  
**A11:** The `route.ts` file in `api/user` defines a `GET` function:  
```tsx
export function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({ message: "Hi there" });
}
```
It returns a JSON response `{ "message": "Hi there" }` when `http://localhost:3000/api/user` is accessed.

---

**Q12: How can you test the modified request counter middleware?**  
**A12:** Run `npm run dev`, then visit `http://localhost:3000/api/user` to see the count increment in the console (e.g., `number of requests is 1`). Visiting `http://localhost:3000` won’t increment it due to the `/api` filter.

---

### Questions and Answers on Selectively Running Middlewares

**Q13: How does the selective middleware example conditionally handle requests?**  
**A13:** In the example:  
```tsx
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/admin')) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/signin', request.url));
  }
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }
}
```
It redirects `/admin` requests to `/signin` and allows `/dashboard` requests to proceed with `NextResponse.next()`.

---

**Q14: What does the `NextResponse.redirect` function do in the selective middleware?**  
**A14:** `NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/signin', request.url))` creates a response that redirects the user to `/signin`, preserving the original request’s URL parameters and query string.

---

**Q15: How does the `matcher` in the selective middleware config work?**  
**A15:** `export const config = { matcher: '/:path*' }` configures the middleware to run for all routes, allowing it to check conditions like `/admin` or `/dashboard` for every request.

---

**Q16: What is the benefit of selectively running middlewares based on URL paths?**  
**A16:** Selectively running middlewares lets you apply specific logic (e.g., authentication for `/admin`, normal processing for `/dashboard`) to different parts of the app, enhancing flexibility and control over the request-response cycle.

---

Here are some questions and answers based on the content you provided about client-side rendering (CSR), server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG). These focus on key concepts, advantages, downsides, and practical implementation details necessary to understand modern web rendering techniques.

---

### Questions and Answers on Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

**Q1: What is client-side rendering (CSR) in modern web development?**  
**A1:** Client-side rendering (CSR) is a technique where the rendering of a webpage is performed in the browser using JavaScript. The server sends an initial HTML file with minimal content, and the client-side JavaScript is responsible for rendering the actual content and updating the user interface dynamically.

**Q2: Why is React a good example of a CSR framework?**  
**A2:** React is a popular JavaScript library widely used for building user interfaces and implementing client-side rendering. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render them when the application's state changes.

**Q3: What are the steps to demonstrate CSR with a React project?**  
**A3:**  
1. Initialize a React project using a tool like Vite or Create React App (`npm create vite@latest`).  
2. Install dependencies (`npm install`).  
3. Build the project for production (`npm run build`).  
4. Serve the project using a static file server (`cd dist/ && serve`).  
5. Open the browser's network tab to see that the initial HTML file lacks content, which is then rendered by JavaScript dynamically.

**Q4: What are the advantages of CSR with frameworks like React?**  
**A4:** React (and other CSR frameworks) make a developer’s life easier by allowing them to write reusable components, and the JavaScript code handles rendering them to the DOM.

**Q5: What are the downsides of client-side rendering?**  
**A5:**  
1. **Not SEO optimized**: Search engines may struggle to index content since the initial HTML file lacks the actual content.  
2. **Flash of unstyled content**: Users may see a blank or unstyled page before the JavaScript renders the content.  
3. **Waterfalling problem**: If the JavaScript is large or slow to download, the page may remain blank until fully loaded and executed.

---

### Questions and Answers on Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

**Q6: What is server-side rendering (SSR) and how does it differ from CSR?**  
**A6:** Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique where the rendering process (converting JavaScript components to HTML) happens on the server. The server generates a fully rendered HTML page and sends it to the client, unlike CSR, where an empty HTML file is sent and JavaScript renders the content in the browser.

**Q7: What are the benefits of using server-side rendering?**  
**A7:**  
1. **SEO Optimizations**: SSR improves SEO by providing search engines with fully rendered HTML pages that are easier to crawl and index.  
2. **Eliminates the "Waterfalling" Problem**: Users receive a fully rendered page immediately, avoiding delays from downloading and executing JavaScript.  
3. **No White Flash**: SSR eliminates the blank screen issue seen in CSR by serving a fully rendered page from the start.

**Q8: How can you create and test an SSR application using Next.js?**  
**A8:**  
1. Create a Next.js app (`npx create-next-app`).  
2. Build the project for production (`npm run build`).  
3. Start the Next.js server (`npm run start`).  
4. Inspect the initial HTML page in the browser to see that it is populated with rendered content, unlike CSR.

**Q9: What are the downsides of server-side rendering?**  
**A9:**  
1. **Expensive**: Every request requires server-side rendering, making it resource-intensive and costly, especially for high-traffic sites.  
2. **Harder to Scale**: Scaling SSR is challenging because rendered pages cannot be easily cached on CDNs like static assets.

---

### Questions and Answers on Static Site Generation (SSG)

**Q10: What is static site generation (SSG) in Next.js?**  
**A10:** Static Site Generation (SSG) is a technique in Next.js where HTML pages are generated at build time rather than dynamically on the server during each request. The pre-rendered HTML can be cached by a CDN for faster delivery to users.

**Q11: What are the benefits of using static site generation?**  
**A11:**  
1. **Improved Performance**: Pre-rendered HTML cached on a CDN results in faster page load times and reduced server load.  
2. **Scalability**: SSG leverages CDN caching, allowing the app to scale easily by serving pages from multiple edge locations.  
3. **Reduced Server Costs**: Rendering happens at build time, reducing server resource usage and potentially lowering hosting costs.

**Q12: How can you implement SSG in a Next.js project for a list of todos?**  
**A12:**  
1. Create a fresh Next.js project (`npx create-next-app static-site-generation`).  
2. Create `todos/page.tsx` with the following code:  
```tsx
export default async function Blog() {
    const res = await fetch('https://sum-server.100xdevs.com/todos');
    const data = await res.json();
    const todos = data.todos;
    return <div>
        {todos.map((todo: any) => <div key={todo.id}>
            {todo.title}
            {todo.description}
        </div>)}
    </div>
}
```
The todos are fetched and rendered at build time since they are the same for all users.

**Q13: How can you update the cache in an SSG application every 10 seconds?**  
**A13:** Use the `revalidate` option in the fetch request:  
```tsx
const res = await fetch('https://sum-server.100xdevs.com/todos', {
    next: { revalidate: 10 }
});
```
This instructs Next.js to revalidate the cached page every 10 seconds.

**Q14: How can you manually revalidate the cache in an SSG application?**  
**A14:** Use the `revalidateTag` function:  
1. Tag the fetch request:  
```tsx
const res = await fetch('https://sum-server.100xdevs.com/todos', { next: { tags: ['todos'] } });
```
2. Create a function to trigger revalidation:  
```tsx
'use server';
import { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache';
export default async function revalidate() {
  revalidateTag('todos');
}
```
This invalidates the cache for pages tagged with 'todos' when called.
