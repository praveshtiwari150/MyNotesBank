Here are the **question-answer pairs** extracted from your content:  

### **1. What is a Promise in JavaScript?**  
A Promise is a JavaScript feature that provides a structured and readable way to work with asynchronous code. It represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, allowing the result or error to be handled in an organized manner.  

### **2. What are the three states of a Promise?**  
A Promise can be in one of the following three states:  
- **Pending:** The initial state before the promise is resolved or rejected.  
- **Fulfilled (Resolved):** The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.  
- **Rejected:** The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.  

### **3. How do Promises help in avoiding callback hell?**  
Promises mitigate callback hell by enabling chaining through the **`.then`** method, making code more readable and maintainable.  
#### **Example:**
```javascript
// Without Promises (Callback Hell)
asyncOperation1((result1) => {
  asyncOperation2(result1, (result2) => {
    asyncOperation3(result2, (result3) => {
      // ...
    });
  });
});

// With Promises (Chaining)
asyncOperation1()
  .then((result1) => asyncOperation2(result1))
  .then((result2) => asyncOperation3(result2))
  .then((result3) => {
    // ...
  });
```

### **4. How do Promises handle errors?**  
Promises have built-in error handling using the **`.catch`** method, which allows a centralized way to handle errors in a sequence of asynchronous operations.  
#### **Example:**
```javascript
asyncOperation1()
  .then((result1) => asyncOperation2(result1))
  .then((result2) => asyncOperation3(result2))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  });
```

### **5. What is `Promise.all`, and when should you use it?**  
`Promise.all` allows multiple promises to execute in parallel and waits for all of them to complete before proceeding. It is useful when multiple independent asynchronous operations need to be completed before moving forward.  
#### **Example:**
```javascript
const promise1 = asyncOperation1();
const promise2 = asyncOperation2();

Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
  .then((results) => {
    const result1 = results[0];
    const result2 = results[1];
    // ...
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  });
```

### **6. How do you create a Promise in JavaScript?**  
A Promise is created using the `Promise` constructor, which takes a function with two parameters: **`resolve`** and **`reject`**.  
#### **Example:**
```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation
  if (/* success */) {
    resolve('Operation succeeded!');
  } else {
    reject('Operation failed!');
  }
});
```

### **7. How do you resolve a Promise?**  
A Promise is resolved by calling the **`resolve`** function inside its executor function.  
#### **Example:**
```javascript
const successfulPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('Operation succeeded!');
  }, 1000);
});
```

### **8. How do you reject a Promise?**  
A Promise is rejected by calling the **`reject`** function inside its executor function.  
#### **Example:**
```javascript
const failedPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    reject('Operation failed!');
  }, 1000);
});
```

### **9. How do you consume a Promise?**  
A Promise can be consumed using **`.then`** for successful resolution and **`.catch`** for error handling.  
#### **Example:**
```javascript
successfulPromise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Output: Operation succeeded!
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

### **10. What happens when you chain `.then()` methods on a Promise?**  
Each `.then()` returns a new Promise, allowing chaining of multiple asynchronous operations sequentially.  
#### **Example:**
```javascript
successfulPromise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Output: Operation succeeded!
    return 'New value';
  })
  .then((newValue) => {
    console.log(newValue); // Output: New value
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

### **11. How does `Promise.all` handle errors?**  
If any of the promises in `Promise.all` fail, the entire `Promise.all` operation fails, and the `.catch()` block is executed.  
#### **Example:**
```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve('One');
const promise2 = Promise.reject('Error in promise2');

Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
  .then((values) => {
    console.log(values);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error); // Output: Error in promise2
  });
```

  ### Questions and Answers Based on the Provided Content

#### **1. What is the purpose of middlewares in Express.js?**
**Answer:** Middlewares in Express.js are used to perform prechecks or operations before the main application logic runs. They help in organizing code by separating preliminary checks (like authentication and input validation) from the core logic, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

---

#### **2. What is the role of the `next()` function in middleware?**
**Answer:** The `next()` function in middleware is a callback that passes control to the next middleware in the stack. If `next()` is not called, the request-response cycle stops, and the client does not receive a response.

---

#### **3. What is the difference between `res.send` and `res.json`?**
**Answer:**  
- `res.send` sends a response of various types (string, Buffer, object, etc.), and Express automatically sets the `Content-Type` based on the data.  
- `res.json` specifically sends a JSON response and sets the `Content-Type` to `application/json`.

---

#### **4. Why is `app.use(express.json())` important in Express?**
**Answer:** `app.use(express.json())` is middleware that parses incoming JSON payloads in the request body. Without it, JSON data in the request body would not be automatically parsed, requiring manual handling.

---

#### **5. What are the three ways to send inputs to an Express server?**
**Answer:**  
1. **Query Parameters** (e.g., `?key=value` in the URL).  
2. **Body** (hidden part of the request, used for form submissions or JSON data).  
3. **Headers** (metadata like authentication tokens or content type).  

---

#### **6. What is the purpose of a global catch (error-handling middleware)?**
**Answer:** A global catch is an error-handling middleware that centralizes error management, ensuring consistent error responses and preventing crashes due to unhandled exceptions. It uses four arguments (`err, req, res, next`) to catch and process errors.

---

#### **7. Why is input validation important in backend applications?**
**Answer:** Input validation ensures that the data received by the server meets expected criteria (e.g., correct format, length, or type), preventing vulnerabilities like malformed inputs or server crashes due to invalid data.

---

#### **8. How does Zod simplify input validation compared to manual `if-else` checks?**
**Answer:** Zod allows developers to define schemas declaratively (e.g., `z.string().min(3)`), automating validation and reducing repetitive `if-else` blocks. It throws structured errors if validation fails, making the code cleaner and less error-prone.

---

#### **9. What are some key features of Zod?**
**Answer:**  
- Supports basic types (`string`, `number`, etc.).  
- Object and nested schema definitions.  
- Array, union, and intersection types.  
- Optional/nullable fields and custom validators.  
- Automatic parsing and TypeScript integration.  

---

#### **10. How does Zod handle validation errors?**
**Answer:** Zodâ€™s `parse()` method throws an error with details (e.g., `error.errors`) if validation fails, allowing developers to send structured error responses (e.g., `res.status(400).json({ error: error.errors })`).

Below is a set of questions and answers derived directly from the content you provided for **Week 3.2: Authentication & Databases**. These focus on key concepts such as the `fetch()` method, asynchronous programming, authentication strategies, and MongoDB, ensuring all answers are sourced from the lecture notes.

---

### Questions and Answers on fetch() Method

**Q1: What is the `fetch()` method in JavaScript, and what does it return?**  
**A1:** The `fetch()` method is a built-in JavaScript function that simplifies making HTTP requests to retrieve data from a server. It returns a Promise that resolves to the `Response` object representing the requestâ€™s outcome, whether successful or not.

---

**Q2: Why is the `fetch()` method used in web applications?**  
**A2:** The `fetch()` method is used for:  
1. **Asynchronous Data Retrieval:** It retrieves data from a server without blocking code execution.  
2. **Web API Interaction:** It simplifies requests to external APIs.  
3. **Promise-Based:** It uses Promises for cleaner async handling with `.then()` and `.catch()`.  
4. **Flexible and Powerful:** It offers more options than older methods like `XMLHttpRequest`.

---

**Q3: How do you handle a successful response and errors using `fetch()`?**  
**A3:** You use `.then()` to process the response and `.catch()` for errors. Example:  
```jsx
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => console.log('Data:', data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Fetch error:', error));
```

---

### Questions and Answers on Asynchronous Concepts

**Q4: What is a callback function, and how does it relate to `fetch()`?**  
**A4:** A callback function is passed as an argument to another function and executed after its completion. In older code, callbacks handled async operations, like those in `.then()` blocks of `fetch()`. Example:  
```jsx
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => callback('Hello, callback!'), 1000);
}
fetchData(result => console.log(result));
```

---

**Q5: What is a Promise, and how does it connect to `fetch()`?**  
**A5:** A Promise is an object representing the eventual success or failure of an async operation, improving readability over callbacks. `fetch()` returns a Promise, handled with `.then()` for success and `.catch()` for errors. Example:  
```jsx
fetchDataPromise()
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

---

**Q6: How does `async/await` improve asynchronous code, and how is it used with `fetch()`?**  
**A6:** `async/await` is syntactic sugar over Promises, making async code look synchronous and more readable. With `fetch()`, it simplifies response handling. Example:  
```jsx
async function fetchDataAndPrint() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
fetchDataAndPrint();
```

---

**Q7: What is the purpose of a `try-catch` block in JavaScript?**  
**A7:** A `try-catch` block handles runtime errors gracefully, preventing program crashes. The `try` block runs code that might fail, and `catch` handles any exceptions. Example:  
```jsx
try {
  const result = 10 / 0;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);
}
```

---

### Questions and Answers on Authentication

**Q8: What is hashing, and why is it used in authentication?**  
**A8:** Hashing converts a password into a fixed-size hash value using a one-way function (e.g., bcrypt). Itâ€™s used to enhance security by storing hashed passwords instead of plaintext, reducing breach risks. Example:  
```jsx
bcrypt.hash('user123', 10, (err, hash) => console.log('Hashed:', hash));
```

---

**Q9: How does encryption differ from hashing in authentication?**  
**A9:** Encryption is a two-way process that protects data confidentiality with a reversible key, unlike hashingâ€™s one-way process. Itâ€™s used for sensitive data like credit card details. Example:  
```jsx
const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-cbc', 'secretKey');
let encrypted = cipher.update('Sensitive information', 'utf-8', 'hex');
encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
```

---

**Q10: What is a JSON Web Token (JWT), and how does it work in authentication?**  
**A10:** A JWT is a digital token with a header, payload, and signature, used to verify user identity. After login, the server issues a JWT, which the client sends with requests. The server verifies it with a key. Example structure: `Header.Payload.Signature`.

---

**Q11: How does Local Storage support authentication?**  
**A11:** Local Storage stores authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs) client-side, persisting sessions across browser restarts. It reduces authentication overhead and improves performance by avoiding repeated logins.

---

**Q12: What is the Authorization header, and how is it used?**  
**A12:** The Authorization header sends credentials (e.g., `Bearer <token>`) in HTTP requests to authenticate clients. The server verifies it to grant access. Example:  
```jsx
axios.get('https://api.example.com/resource', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

---

**Q13: How do cookies differ from Local Storage for storing JWTs?**  
**A13:** Cookies are secure with HTTP-only flags, auto-sent with requests, and can expire, while Local Storage is easier to use, has more capacity, but requires manual request attachment and expiration handling.

---

**Q14: What are the advantages of Axios over `fetch()` for HTTP requests?**  
**A14:** Axios auto-parses JSON, supports interceptors, offers detailed request configuration, and ensures consistent behavior across browsers, unlike `fetch()`, which requires manual JSON parsing and lacks interceptors.

---

### Questions and Answers on Databases and MongoDB

**Q15: Why is storing data in memory problematic for real-world applications?**  
**A15:** 1. **Data Canâ€™t Be Dynamic:** In-memory data is volatile and lost on restart.

**A16:** 1. **Graph Databases:** Neo4j (for relationships).  
2. **Vector Databases:** InfluxDB (for spatial data).  
3. **SQL Databases:** PostgreSQL (tabular structure).  
4. **NoSQL Databases:** MongoDB (flexible modeling).

---

**Q17: What are the key features of MongoDB?**  
**A17:** 1. **Database Creation:** Multiple databases as containers.  
2. **Collection Creation:** Groups documents like tables.  
3. **JSON Data Storage:** Uses BSON format.  
4. **Schemaless Design:** Flexible document structures.  
5. **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling across servers.  
6. **Versatility:** Adapts to diverse use cases.

---

**Q18: What is Mongoose, and how does it connect to MongoDB?**  
**A18:** Mongoose is an ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing schema-based abstraction. It simplifies connecting to MongoDB, defining models, and performing CRUD operations.

---

**Q19: How do Express, JWT, and Mongoose work together to connect a backend to a database?**  
**A19:** **Express** creates the server and handles requests. **JWT** authenticates users via tokens, reducing server-side session storage. **Mongoose** connects to MongoDB, managing data interactions with schemas and models.

---

**Q20: What is the first step to create a free MongoDB instance using MongoDB Atlas?**  
**A20:** Visit the MongoDB Atlas website at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign up or log in.

### Questions and Answers on ECMA Scripts and Auxiliary APIs

**Q1: What is ECMAScript, and how does it relate to JavaScript?**  
**A1:** ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification that serves as the standard upon which JavaScript is based. It acts as a set of rules and guidelines ensuring JavaScript behaves consistently, like a manual defining its features and functionality.

---

**Q2: What are Auxiliary APIs in web development?**  
**A2:** Auxiliary APIs are additional interfaces and functionalities provided by browsers or runtime environments beyond core JavaScript (ECMAScript). They extend JavaScriptâ€™s capabilities for tasks like browser interaction, server-side operations, or third-party service integration.

---

**Q3: What are some examples of Auxiliary APIs mentioned, and their purposes?**  
**A3:**  
1. **Node.js APIs:** Provide server-side features like file system access (e.g., `fs.readFile`).  
2. **Third-Party APIs:** Enable integration with external services (e.g., Google Maps API for maps).  
3. **Web APIs:** Offer browser-specific functionality like DOM manipulation, Fetch API for requests, and Web Storage for local storage.

---

### Questions and Answers on Understanding Document and DOM Manipulation

**Q4: What is the Document in JavaScript, and what is its role in the DOM?**  
**A4:** The `document` object is the root object of the DOM (Document Object Model), representing the entire HTML or XML document. It provides an entry point to the DOM, allowing developers to use its methods and properties to dynamically interact with and manipulate a web pageâ€™s content.

---

**Q5: How does the DOM allow JavaScript to manipulate HTML?**  
**A5:** The DOM represents the HTML document as a tree-like structure, with each element (e.g., buttons, paragraphs) as a node. JavaScript can interact with this tree to change, add, or remove elements, updating the webpage dynamically.

---

**Q6: How can JavaScript change HTML content using the DOM, with an example?**  
**A6:** JavaScript uses DOM methods like `getElementById` and properties like `textContent` to modify HTML. Example:  
```html
<button id="simpleButton">Click me!</button>
<p id="output"></p>
<script>
  const button = document.getElementById('simpleButton');
  const para = document.getElementById('output');
  button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    para.textContent = 'Awesome! You clicked the button!';
  });
</script>
```
When clicked, the button updates the paragraphâ€™s content.

---

**Q7: How does DOM rendering work in a simple calculator example?**  
**A7:** In a calculator example, DOM rendering retrieves input values, calculates a result, and updates the page:  
```html
<input id="num1" type="number">
<input id="num2" type="number">
<button id="calculateButton">Calculate Sum</button>
<p id="sumResult"></p>
<script>
  const num1Input = document.getElementById('num1');
  const num2Input = document.getElementById('num2');
  const button = document.getElementById('calculateButton');
  const result = document.getElementById('sumResult');
  button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const sum = (parseFloat(num1Input.value) || 0) + (parseFloat(num2Input.value) || 0);
    result.textContent = `Sum: ${sum}`;
  });
</script>
```
Clicking the button displays the sum in the paragraph.

---

### Questions and Answers on Classes vs IDs and Element Selection

**Q8: What are the differences between Classes and IDs in HTML?**  
**A8:**  
- **Classes:** Group multiple elements, can be shared, and an element can have multiple classes (e.g., `<p class="highlight">`).  
- **IDs:** Uniquely identify one element, must be unique per page (e.g., `<div id="example">`).  
- **Uniqueness:** Classes can repeat; IDs cannot.  
- **Application:** Classes style multiple elements; IDs target specific elements for styling or JavaScript.

---

**Q9: What does `querySelector()` do, and how is it used?**  
**A9:** `querySelector()` selects the first element matching a CSS selector. Syntax: `document.querySelector('selector')`. Example:  
```html
<div id="example">This is an example.</div>
<script>
  const element = document.querySelector('#example');
  element.style.color = 'blue';
</script>
```
It changes the text color of the element with ID "example" to blue.

---

**Q10: How does `getElementById()` differ from `getElementsByClassName()`?**  
**A10:**  
- **getElementById():** Selects one element by its unique ID (e.g., `document.getElementById('example')`).  
- **getElementsByClassName():** Selects all elements with a specific class, returning a collection (e.g., `document.getElementsByClassName('highlight')`). Example:  
```html
<div id="example">Example</div>
<p class="highlight">Highlight</p>
<script>
  document.getElementById('example').style.color = 'red';
  const elements = document.getElementsByClassName('highlight');
  for (const el of elements) el.style.fontWeight = 'bold';
</script>
```

---

### Questions and Answers on Communicating to the Backend

**Q11: How does the frontend communicate with a backend server using `fetch`?**  
**A11:** The frontend uses the `fetch` API to send requests to a backend URL with parameters. Example:  
```html
<input id="firstNumber" type="text">
<input id="secondNumber" type="text">
<button onclick="populateDiv()">Calculate sum</button>
<div id="finalSum"></div>
<script>
  function populateDiv() {
    const a = document.getElementById("firstNumber").value;
    const b = document.getElementById("secondNumber").value;
    fetch("https://sum-server.100xdevs.com/sum?a=" + a + "&b=" + b)
      .then(response => response.text())
      .then(ans => document.getElementById("finalSum").innerHTML = ans);
  }
</script>
```
It fetches the sum from the backend and displays it in the `finalSum` div.

---

**Q12: How does `async/await` improve backend communication compared to `.then()`?**  
**A12:** `async/await` makes the code more concise and readable by pausing execution until the Promise resolves. Example:  
```html
<script>
  async function populateDiv2() {
    const a = document.getElementById("firstNumber").value;
    const b = document.getElementById("secondNumber").value;
    const response = await fetch("https://sum-server.100xdevs.com/sum?a=" + a + "&b=" + b);
    const ans = await response.text();
    document.getElementById("finalSum").innerHTML = ans;
  }
</script>
```
It performs the same task as `populateDiv()` but with cleaner syntax.

---

### Questions and Answers on onInput and Debouncing

**Q13: What is the `onInput` event, and when is it triggered?**  
**A13:** The `onInput` event is an event handler triggered dynamically whenever a user changes an input fieldâ€™s value by typing or modifying it. Itâ€™s used for real-time actions as the user interacts with the input.

---

**Q14: What is debouncing, and why is it useful with `onInput`?**  
**A14:** Debouncing delays the execution of time-consuming tasks (e.g., requests) until the user stops typing for a specified duration. Itâ€™s useful with `onInput` to reduce unnecessary calls, improving efficiency. Example:  
```html
<input id="textInput" onInput="debounce(handleInput, 500)">
<p id="displayText"></p>
<script>
  function debounce(func, delay) {
    let timeoutId;
    return function() {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
      timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, arguments), delay);
    };
  }
  function handleInput() {
    const value = document.getElementById("textInput").value;
    document.getElementById("displayText").innerText = "You typed: " + value;
    console.log("Request sent:", value);
  }
</script>
```
It waits 500ms after typing stops to update the display.

---

**Q15: How does the `debounce` function work in the example?**  
**A15:** The `debounce` function takes a function (`func`) and delay, returning a new function that:  
- Clears any existing timeout with `clearTimeout`.  
- Sets a new timeout with `setTimeout` to call `func` after the delay.  
If the user keeps typing within 500ms, the timeout resets, ensuring `handleInput` runs only after a pause.

---

### Questions and Answers on Throttling vs Rate Limiting

**Q16: What is throttling, and what is its purpose?**  
**A16:** Throttling controls the rate at which an action is performed, limiting its frequency within a time frame. Its purpose is to ensure a smooth user experience by preventing rapid consecutive actions.

---

**Q17: What is rate limiting, and how does it differ from throttling?**  
**A17:** Rate limiting controls the number of requests a client can make in a time period, protecting server resources and ensuring fairness. It differs from throttling, which focuses on action frequency for user experience, while rate limiting is server-side and limits request counts.

---

**Q18: What are the key differences between throttling and rate limiting?**  
**A18:**  
- **Focus:** Throttling controls action frequency; rate limiting controls request count.  
- **Application:** Throttling applies to various actions; rate limiting is often API-level.  
- **Goal:** Throttling enhances user experience; rate limiting protects server resources and enforces fairness.

### **fetch() Method**

**Q1: What is the `fetch()` method in JavaScript, and what does it return?**  
**A1:** The `fetch()` method is a built-in JavaScript function that simplifies making HTTP requests to retrieve data from a server. It returns a Promise that resolves to the `Response` object representing the response to that request, whether successful or not.

**Q2: Why is the `fetch()` method used in web development?**  
**A2:** It is used for:  
1. **Asynchronous Data Retrieval**: It retrieves data asynchronously, allowing the code to continue without waiting, which is crucial for responsive web applications.  
2. **Web API Interaction**: It simplifies making HTTP requests to external APIs.  
3. **Promise-Based**: It returns a Promise, enabling clean asynchronous handling with `.then()` and `.catch()`.  
4. **Flexible and Powerful**: It offers more flexibility and power than older methods like `XMLHttpRequest`, supporting various options and response types.

**Q3: Provide a basic example of using the `fetch()` method from the content.**  
**A3:** Example:  
```jsx
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log('Data from server:', data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Fetch error:', error);
  });
```

### **fetch() vs Axios**

**Q4: What are the key characteristics of the Fetch API?**  
**A4:** The key characteristics are:  
1. **Native Browser API**: Built into modern browsers for HTTP requests.  
2. **Promise-Based**: Returns a Promise, supporting modern asynchronous coding with `.then()` or `async/await`.  
3. **Lightweight**: Bundled with browsers, requiring no external dependencies.

**Q5: What are the key features of Axios?**  
**A5:** The key features are:  
1. **External Library**: A standalone library for browsers and Node.js.  
2. **Promise-Based**: Returns a Promise for consistent asynchronous handling.  
3. **HTTP Request and Response Interceptors**: Allows global modification of requests or responses.  
4. **Automatic JSON Parsing**: Automatically parses JSON responses.

**Q6: How does `fetch` differ from Axios in terms of JSON parsing?**  
**A6:** With `fetch`, you need to manually call `.json()` on the response to parse JSON data. Axios automatically parses JSON responses, making it simpler as you can directly access `response.data`.

**Q7: What is a major advantage of Axios over `fetch` regarding request configuration?**  
**A7:** Axios allows detailed configuration of requests through a variety of options, whereas `fetch` requires more manual setup for headers, methods, and other configurations.

**Q8: When should you use `fetch` instead of Axios?**  
**A8:** Use `fetch` when:  
- Working on a modern project without needing additional features.  
- Preferring a lightweight solution without external dependencies or polyfill concerns.

**Q9: When should you choose Axios over `fetch`?**  
**A9:** Use Axios when:  
- Dealing with complex scenarios requiring interceptors.  
- Needing consistent behavior across different browsers.  
- Desiring built-in features like automatic JSON parsing.

### **Comparison Points**

**Q10: How do `fetch` and Axios handle HTTP errors differently?**  
**A10:** Both allow error handling with `.catch()` or `.finally()`, but Axios may provide more detailed error information by default, while `fetch` requires checking `response.ok` and throwing errors manually for non-200 status codes.

**Q11: What is a limitation of `fetch` compared to Axios in terms of interceptors?**  
**A11:** `fetch` lacks built-in support for interceptors, whereas Axios provides interceptors for globally modifying requests and responses before they reach `.then()` or `.catch()`.

**Q12: How does browser support differ between `fetch` and Axios?**  
**A12:** `fetch` is natively supported in modern browsers but may need a polyfill for older browsers. Axios offers consistent behavior across various browsers and doesnâ€™t rely on native implementations.

**Q13: Which is lighter in terms of project size, `fetch` or Axios?**  
**A13:** `fetch` is lighter as itâ€™s part of the browser, while Axios, being an external library, adds additional file size to the project.

### **Comparing Code Implementation**

**Q14: How do you make a GET request using `fetch` with `async/await` according to the content?**  
**A14:** Example:  
```jsx
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}
fetchData();
```

**Q15: How do you make a GET request using Axios with `async/await`?**  
**A15:** Example:  
```jsx
import axios from 'axios';

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}
fetchData();
```

**Q16: Provide an example of a POST request using `fetch` with `async/await` from the content.**  
**A16:** Example:  
```jsx
async function postData() {
  const url = 'https://api.example.com/postData';
  const dataToSend = {
    key1: 'value1',
    key2: 'value2',
  };

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(dataToSend),
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}
postData();
```

**Q17: Provide an example of a POST request using Axios with `async/await` from the content.**  
**A17:** Example:  
```jsx
import axios from 'axios';

async function postData() {
  const url = 'https://api.example.com/postData';
  const dataToSend = {
    key1: 'value1',
    key2: 'value2',
  };

  try {
    const response = await axios.post(url, dataToSend);
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}
postData();
```

**Q18: What is a key difference in sending data between GET and POST requests as noted in the content?**  
**A18:** In GET requests, you can send headers but not a body, while in POST, DELETE, and PUT requests, you can send both headers and a body.
