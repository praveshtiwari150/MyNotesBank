### Questions and Answers on Volumes in Docker

**Q1: What is the default behavior of storage in Docker containers, and how can you observe it?**  
**A1:**  
- **Default Behavior**: Data is ephemeral; it’s lost when the container stops or is removed.  
- **Observation**: Run `docker run 100xdevs/write-random`, then `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash` and `cat randomData.txt`. Stop the container and rerun it—data is gone.

**Q2: How do bind mounts and volume mounts differ in Docker, and how do you use them?**  
**A2:**  
- **Bind Mounts**: Map a host directory to a container path. Example: `docker run -v /Users/harkiratsingh/Projects/100x/mount:/usr/src/app/generated 100xdevs/write-random`.  
- **Volume Mounts**: Use Docker-managed volumes. Create: `docker volume create hello`. Use: `docker run -v hello:/usr/src/app/generated 100xdevs/write-random`.  
- **Difference**: Bind mounts rely on host paths; volume mounts are managed by Docker for portability.

**Q3: What’s the key takeaway about data persistence in Docker volumes?**  
**A3:** Volumes (bind or managed) persist data across container restarts/removals, unlike ephemeral storage, making them essential for stateful apps.

### Questions and Answers on Volumes in Kubernetes

**Q4: Why are volumes necessary in Kubernetes?**  
**A4:**  
1. **Inter-Container Sharing**: Share data between containers in a pod.  
2. **Data Persistence**: Retain data across container restarts (e.g., for databases).  
3. **Temporary Storage**: Provide scratch space (e.g., caching).

**Q5: What are the main types of volumes in Kubernetes, and how do they differ?**  
**A5:**  
1. **Ephemeral Volumes**: Temporary, tied to pod lifecycle (e.g., `emptyDir`, ConfigMap, Secret).  
2. **Persistent Volumes (PVs)**: Independent of pods, provisioned statically or dynamically.  
3. **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**: User requests for PV storage, specifying size/modes.

---

### Questions and Answers on Ephemeral Volumes

**Q6: How do you create an ephemeral volume to share data between containers in a pod?**  
**A6:** Use `kube.yml`:  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: shared-volume-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: shared-volume-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: shared-volume-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: writer
        image: busybox
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'Hello from Writer Pod' > /data/hello.txt; sleep 3600"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-data
          mountPath: /data
      - name: reader
        image: busybox
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "cat /data/hello.txt; sleep 3600"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-data
          mountPath: /data
      volumes:
      - name: shared-data
        emptyDir: {}
```
Apply: `kubectl apply -f kube.yml`.

**Q7: What happens to data in an `emptyDir` volume when a pod is deleted?**  
**A7:** Data is lost when the pod is deleted or rescheduled to another node, as `emptyDir` is tied to the pod’s lifecycle.

**Q8: What are some use cases for ephemeral volumes?**  
**A8:** Temporary scratch space, data sharing between containers, caching.

---

### Questions and Answers on Persistent Volumes

**Q9: What are Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)?**  
**A9:**  
- **PVs**: Cluster storage resources, provisioned manually or dynamically, independent of pods.  
- **PVCs**: User requests for storage, binding to PVs based on size and access modes.

**Q10: What are the access modes and reclaim policies for PVs?**  
**A10:**  
- **Access Modes**:  
  - ReadWriteOnce (RWO): Single node read-write.  
  - ReadOnlyMany (ROX): Multi-node read-only.  
  - ReadWriteMany (RWX): Multi-node read-write.  
- **Reclaim Policies**:  
  - Retain: Keep data for manual cleanup.  
  - Delete: Remove volume and data.  
  - Recycle: Scrub data (deprecated).

### Questions and Answers on Static Persistent Volumes

**Q11: How do you set up an NFS server for a static PV on AWS?**  
**A11:** Use Docker Compose:  
```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  nfs-server:
    image: itsthenetwork/nfs-server-alpine:latest
    container_name: nfs-server
    privileged: true
    environment:
      SHARED_DIRECTORY: /exports
    volumes:
      - ./data:/exports:rw
    ports:
      - "2049:2049"
    restart: unless-stopped
```
Ensure port 2049 is open.

**Q12: How do you create a static PV and PVC for NFS, and use it in a MongoDB pod?**  
**A12:** Use YAML:  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:

    - mountPath: "/data/db"
      name: nfs-volume
  volumes:
  - name: nfs-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: nfs-pvc
```
Apply: `kubectl apply -f <file>`.

**Q13: How do you test data persistence with a static PV?**  
**A13:**  
1. Insert: `kubectl exec -it mongo-pod -- mongo`, `use mydb`, `db.mycollection.insert({ name: "Test", value: "This is a test" })`.  
2. Delete/Recreate: `kubectl delete pod mongo-pod`, `kubectl apply -f mongo.yml`.  
3. Verify: `kubectl exec -it mongo-pod -- mongo`, `use mydb`, `db.mycollection.find()`—data persists.

### Questions and Answers on Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

**Q16: What is the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), and how does it work?**  
**A16:**  
- **Definition**: HPA adjusts pod replicas in Deployments/ReplicaSets/StatefulSets based on metrics (e.g., CPU).  
- **Purpose**: Scales out (more pods) or in (fewer pods) to handle load.  
- **Operation**: Runs as a control loop (every 15 seconds), fetching metrics via API server.

**Q17: What components support HPA, and how do you install the Metrics Server?**  
**A17:**  
- **Components**:  
  - **cAdvisor**: Collects container resource data.  
  - **Metrics Server**: Stores and exposes metrics via API.  
- **Install**: `kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml`.  
- **Verify**: `kubectl top pod -n kube-system`.

**Q18: How does HPA fetch metrics, and what’s an example request?**  
**A18:** HPA controller queries the API server for metrics. Example:  
`GET https://[cluster-url]/apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/default/pods`.

Here are questions and answers based on the "Week 29.2" lecture content about advanced Kubernetes concepts, focusing on Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), resource requests and limits, cluster autoscaling, and the Kubernetes lab. These are designed to solidify understanding, with answers sourced directly from the provided content.

---

### Questions and Answers on Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

**Q1: What is the purpose of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes?**  
**A1:** HPA automatically adjusts pod replicas in Deployments, ReplicaSets, or StatefulSets based on metrics like CPU utilization or custom metrics, scaling out (adding pods) under high load and scaling in (reducing pods) when demand drops, ensuring efficient resource use.

**Q2: How does HPA operate architecturally, and what components support it?**  
**A2:**  
- **Architecture**: Operates as a control loop, checking metrics every 15 seconds via the API server.  
- **Components**:  
  - **cAdvisor**: Collects container resource data.  
  - **Metrics Server**: Aggregates and exposes CPU/memory metrics.

**Q3: How do you install the Metrics Server and verify its functionality?**  
**A3:**  
- **Install**: `kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml`.  
- **Verify**: `kubectl top pod -n kube-system` or `kubectl top nodes -n kube-system` to view resource usage.

---

### Questions and Answers on Demo App

**Q4: What is the purpose of the demo app, and how does it support HPA testing?**  
**A4:**  
- **Purpose**: A CPU-intensive Express.js app (`100xdevs/week-28`) with a route (`/`) that runs a 10-billion-iteration loop.  
- **Support for HPA**: Its predictable CPU load increases with requests, triggering HPA to scale pods up/down, observable via scaling behavior.

**Q5: What’s the expected behavior of the demo app under load with HPA?**  
**A5:**  
- Low load: Runs on minimal pods (e.g., 2).  
- High load: CPU usage spikes, HPA adds pods (up to max, e.g., 5).  
- Load drop: HPA reduces pods when CPU falls below threshold.

### Questions and Answers on Creating Manifests for K8s Deployment with HPA

**Q6: How do you create a Deployment, Service, and HPA for the demo app?**  
**A6:**  
- **Deployment** (`deployment.yml`):  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cpu-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: cpu-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: cpu-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: cpu-app
        image: 100xdevs/week-28:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```
- **Service** (`service.yml`):  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: cpu-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: cpu-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
  type: LoadBalancer
```
- **HPA** (`hpa.yml`):  
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: cpu-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: cpu-deployment
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 50
```
Apply: `kubectl apply -f service.yml`, `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`, `kubectl apply -f hpa.yml`.

**Q7: How does HPA decide when to scale up or down?**  
**A7:**  
- **Scale Up**: If any metric (e.g., CPU) exceeds its threshold (e.g., 50%).  
- **Scale Down**: Only when all metrics are below thresholds, ensuring conservative reduction.

---

### Questions and Answers on Scaling Up

**Q8: How do you update a Deployment with resource limits for HPA scaling?**  
**A8:** Update `deployment.yml`:  
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: cpu-app
    image: 100xdevs/week-28:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 3000
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "100m"
      limits:
        cpu: "1000m"
```
Apply: `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`. This ensures proper metric collection for HPA.

**Q9: How do you simulate load and monitor HPA scaling?**  
**A9:**  
- **Load Test**: `npm i -g loadtest`, `loadtest -c 10 --rps 200 http://<external-ip>`.  
- **Monitor**:  
  - `kubectl top pods`: Check CPU usage.  
  - `kubectl get hpa`: View HPA status.  
  - `kubectl get pods`: Observe pod count increase.

---

### Questions and Answers on Formula for Scaling Up

**Q10: What’s the formula for HPA scaling, and how does it work?**  
**A10:**  
- **Formula**: `New Desired Capacity = Total CPU Utilization / Target CPU Utilization`.  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Total CPU Utilization: Sum of CPU used by all pods (e.g., 2000m across 2 pods = 1000m each).  
  - Target CPU Utilization: HPA target (e.g., 50% of 100m request = 50m).  
  - Example: 2000m / 50m = 40 pods (rounded up), but capped at `maxReplicas` (e.g., 5).

---

### Questions and Answers on Resource Requests & Limits

**Q11: What’s the difference between resource requests and limits in Kubernetes?**  
**A11:**  
- **Requests**: Minimum guaranteed resources (e.g., `cpu: "100m"`). Containers can exceed if available.  
- **Limits**: Maximum allowed resources (e.g., `cpu: "300m"`). Containers cannot exceed.

**Q12: How does limiting CPU to 30% affect a Node.js app?**  
**A12:** Use:  
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
  limits:
    cpu: "300m"
```
- Node.js (single-threaded) can use up to 100% CPU, but the 300m limit restricts it to 30% of a core, capping performance.

**Q13: What happens when requesting more resources than available?**  
**A13:** Use:  
```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 10
  containers:
  - name: cpu-app
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "1000m"
      limits:
        cpu: "1000m"
```
- Requests 10 CPUs total. If the cluster lacks capacity, some pods stay in `Pending` state until resources are available.

---

### Questions and Answers on Cluster Autoscaling

**Q14: What is Cluster Autoscaler, and how does it handle underprovisioned resources?**  
**A14:**  
- **Definition**: Adjusts cluster node count based on resource demands, ensuring pods run and avoiding excess nodes.  
- **Underprovisioned Scenario**: For a Deployment requesting 10 CPUs (e.g., 10 replicas at 1000m each), if insufficient nodes exist, pods remain `Pending`. Cluster Autoscaler adds nodes.

**Q15: How do you configure and test cluster autoscaling?**  
**A15:**  
- **Configure**: Set a dynamic node pool with min/max node counts in the cloud provider.  
- **Test**: Apply the 10-replica Deployment, delete/reapply (`kubectl delete deployment cpu-deployment`, `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`), and observe new nodes added.  
- **Monitor**: `kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep cluster-autoscaler`.

**Q16: How does downscaling work with Cluster Autoscaler?**  
**A16:** Reduce replicas or resource requests (e.g., from 10 to fewer pods or lower CPU). Cluster Autoscaler eventually removes unneeded nodes when resource demand drops.

---

### Questions and Answers on Kubernetes Lab

**Q17: What components are included in the Kubernetes lab, and what do they teach?**  
**A17:**  
- **PV/PVC**: For PostgreSQL/Redis—teaches persistent storage.  
- **Deployments**: Redis, PostgreSQL, Next.js, judge API/workers—teaches app deployment.  
- **Services**: ClusterIP (Redis/PostgreSQL), LoadBalancer (Next.js)—teaches service types.  
- **Resource Management**: Limits/requests for judge workers—teaches resource allocation.  
- **HPA**: Scales on Redis queue length—teaches advanced autoscaling.  
- **Custom Metrics**: Expose metrics for scaling—teaches custom scaling.  
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection—teaches monitoring integration.  
- **KEDA**: Queue-based scaling—teaches event-driven autoscaling.

### Questions and Answers on Recap of Concepts

**Q1: What is Docker, and how does it relate to container orchestration engines like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes?**  
**A1:**  
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, managing them on a single host.  
- **Relation**: Docker provides the container runtime, while orchestration engines like Docker Swarm (native to Docker) and Kubernetes (external) manage containers across multiple hosts.

**Q2: How do Docker Swarm and Kubernetes differ as container orchestration tools?**  
**A2:**  
- **Complexity**: Docker Swarm is simpler; Kubernetes is complex.  
- **Production Use**: Kubernetes is widely adopted; Docker Swarm is less common.  
- **Scaling**: Kubernetes supports autoscaling; Docker Swarm requires manual scaling.  
- **CLI**: Docker Swarm uses Docker CLI; Kubernetes uses `kubectl`.

---

### Questions and Answers on Docker Swarm

**Q3: What is Docker Swarm, and what are its key characteristics?**  
**A3:**  
- **Definition**: Docker’s native orchestration system, managing a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system.  
- **Characteristics**: Easier than Kubernetes, less used in production, built into Docker Engine, uses services/tasks/containers as core concepts.

**Q4: What are the core concepts of Docker Swarm, and how do they function?**  
**A4:**  
- **Services**: Define the desired state of an app (e.g., replicas, image), managed by the swarm.  
- **Tasks**: Atomic scheduling units, each representing one container instance of a service.  
- **Containers**: Running instances of Docker images, created from tasks.

---

### Questions and Answers on Architecture

**Q5: What are the roles of Manager and Worker nodes in Docker Swarm architecture?**  
**A5:**  
- **Manager Nodes**: Handle cluster management, maintain state using Raft consensus, and schedule tasks.  
- **Worker Nodes**: Execute tasks (containers) assigned by managers, communicate via a Gossip network.

**Q6: How does Docker Swarm ensure consistency and scalability in its architecture?**  
**A6:**  
- **Consistency**: Managers use Raft consensus and an internal distributed state store.  
- **Scalability**: Add worker nodes for workload, multiple managers for fault tolerance.

---

### Questions and Answers on Services, Tasks & Containers

**Q7: How do Services, Tasks, and Containers relate in Docker Swarm?**  
**A7:**  
- **Service**: Defines app state (e.g., “3 nginx replicas”).  
- **Tasks**: Created by the manager for each replica (e.g., nginx.1, nginx.2, nginx.3).  
- **Containers**: Running instances of the image (e.g., `nginx:latest`) for each task, distributed across nodes.

**Q8: What does the service diagram illustrate about task distribution?**  
**A8:** The diagram shows a service with 3 nginx replicas, creating 3 tasks (nginx.1, nginx.2, nginx.3), each mapped to a container, distributed across swarm nodes by the manager.

---

### Questions and Answers on Creating a 2 Node Swarm

**Q9: What are the steps to set up a two-node Docker Swarm cluster using EC2 machines?**  
**A9:**  
1. **Setup**: Create two EC2 instances, install Docker on both.  
2. **Initialize**: On the first (manager), run `docker swarm init` to start the swarm and get a join token.  
3. **Join**: On the second (worker), run `docker swarm join --token <TOKEN> <MANAGER-IP>:2377`.  
4. **Network**: Open port 2377 on the manager for swarm communication.  
5. **Verify**: On the manager, run `docker node ls` to confirm both nodes are listed.

**Q10: Why is port 2377 significant in setting up a Docker Swarm?**  
**A10:** Port 2377 is used for swarm management communication between manager and worker nodes, and must be open on the manager for the swarm to function.

---

### Questions and Answers on Deploying a Service

**Q11: How do you deploy an nginx service with 3 replicas in Docker Swarm?**  
**A11:** Run:  
```bash
docker service create --replicas 3 --name helloworld -p 3000:80 nginx
```
- Creates a service “helloworld” with 3 nginx replicas, mapping host port 3000 to container port 80.

**Q12: How do you verify and test the resilience of a deployed service in Docker Swarm?**  
**A12:**  
- **Verify**:  
  - `docker service ls`: Check service status and replicas.  
  - Visit `<manager-ip>:3000` to see the nginx page.  
- **Test Resilience**: List containers (`docker ps`), remove some (`docker rm -f <container_id>`), and check if Swarm recreates them to maintain 3 replicas.

**Q13: How do you remove a service from Docker Swarm?**  
**A13:** Run:  
```bash
docker service rm helloworld
```
- Deletes the “helloworld” service and all its containers.
