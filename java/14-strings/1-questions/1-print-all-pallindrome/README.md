**Problem Statement:**

Given a string \( S \), write a Java program to identify and print all distinct palindromic substrings present in \( S \).

**Input:**

- A single string \( S \) consisting of lowercase English letters (a-z).

**Output:**

- A list of all distinct palindromic substrings found in \( S \), each printed on a new line.

**Definitions:**

- **Substring:** A contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
- **Palindrome:** A string that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., "madam" or "racecar".

**Example:**

*Input:*


```
ababa
```


*Output:*


```
a
aba
ababa
b
bab
```


**Note:**

- In the example above, the palindromic substrings are "a", "aba", "ababa", "b", and "bab".
- Each substring is printed once, even if it appears multiple times in \( S \).

**Constraints:**

- The length of \( S \) is between 1 and 1000 characters.
- The solution should handle the input efficiently within these constraints.

**Additional Information:**

- This problem is related to the "Palindromic Substrings" problem on LeetCode, which focuses on counting palindromic substrings. citeturn0search0
- Efficient algorithms for finding palindromic substrings are discussed in various computational studies. citeturn0academia21
