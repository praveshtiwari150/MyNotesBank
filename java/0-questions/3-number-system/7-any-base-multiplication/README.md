### Question: Multiply Two Numbers in Any Base

You are given a base `b`. You are also given two numbers `n1` and `n2`, both in base `b`.  
You are required to multiply the two numbers and print their product in base `b`.

---

### Input Format:
- A base `b`  
- A number `n1`  
- A number `n2`

---

### Output Format:
- A number of base `b` equal in value to `n1 × n2`

---

### Constraints:
- 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10  
- 0 ≤ `n1`, `n2` ≤ 10⁹  
- `n1` and `n2` are valid numbers in base `b`

---

### Sample Input:
```
5
23
14
```

### Sample Output:
```
1122
```

---

### Explanation:
- Base `b` = 5  
- `23` in base 5 = 13 in decimal  
- `14` in base 5 = 9 in decimal  
- 13 × 9 = 117  
- 117 in base 5 = `1122`
