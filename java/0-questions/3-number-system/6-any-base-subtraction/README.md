### Question: Subtract Two Numbers in Any Base

You are given a base `b`. You are also given two numbers `n1` and `n2`, both in base `b`.  
You are required to subtract `n2` from `n1` and print their difference in base `b`.

---

### Input Format:
- A base `b`  
- A number `n1`  
- A number `n2`

---

### Output Format:
- A number of base `b` equal in value to `n1 - n2`

---

### Constraints:
- 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10  
- 0 ≤ `n2` ≤ `n1` ≤ 10⁹  
- `n1` and `n2` are valid numbers in base `b`

---

### Sample Input:
```
8
157
125
```

### Sample Output:
```
32
```

---

### Explanation:
- Base `b` = 8  
- `157` in base 8 = 111 in decimal  
- `125` in base 8 = 85 in decimal  
- 111 - 85 = 26  
- 26 in base 8 = `32`
