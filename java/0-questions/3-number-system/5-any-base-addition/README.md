### Question: Add Two Numbers in Any Base

You are given a base `b`. You are also given two numbers `n1` and `n2`, both in base `b`.  
You are required to add the two numbers and print their value in base `b`.

---

### Input Format:
- A base `b`  
- A number `n1`  
- A number `n2`

---

### Output Format:
- A number of base `b` equal in value to the sum of `n1` and `n2`

---

### Constraints:
- 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10  
- 0 ≤ `n1`, `n2` ≤ 10⁹  
- `n1` and `n2` are valid numbers in base `b`

---

### Sample Input:
```
8
125
157
```

### Sample Output:
```
304
```

---

### Explanation:
- Base `b` = 8  
- `125` in base 8 = 85 in decimal  
- `157` in base 8 = 111 in decimal  
- 85 + 111 = 196  
- 196 in base 8 = `304`
