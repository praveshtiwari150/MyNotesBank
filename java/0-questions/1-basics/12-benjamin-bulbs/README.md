I'll help you create a clearer coding problem statement.

# Coding Problem: Light Bulb Switcher Challenge

## Problem Description:

You have `n` light bulbs in a row, all initially turned off. You perform `n` operations on these bulbs:

1. In the first operation, you toggle the state of every bulb (turning them all on).
2. In the second operation, you toggle every 2nd bulb (bulbs 2, 4, 6, ...).
3. In the third operation, you toggle every 3rd bulb (bulbs 3, 6, 9, ...).
4. And so on... In the `i`-th operation, you toggle every `i`-th bulb.

## Input:
- A single integer `n` representing the number of bulbs and operations.

## Output:
- A list of all bulb positions that will be ON after all `n` operations are complete.

## Example:
```
Input: n = 16
Output: 1 4 9 16
```

## Explanation:
After 16 operations, only bulbs at positions 1, 4, 9, and 16 will be on.

## Constraints:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9

## Notes:
- A bulb is toggled if and only if its position is divisible by the current operation number.
- The challenge asks you to identify a pattern rather than simulate all operations.

# Bulb Switching Pattern Analysis

Let's analyze the pattern of bulb switches through a visual representation:

## Pattern Observation

Looking at the table, we can see a clear pattern:

1. Each bulb gets toggled (✓) exactly once for each of its factors
2. The bulbs that remain ON after all operations are: 1, 4, 9, and 16

## What These Numbers Have in Common

These numbers (1, 4, 9, 16) are all perfect squares. Why do perfect squares end up in the ON state?

When we examine the factors of each number:
* Perfect squares have an odd number of factors (because one factor is paired with itself)
* All other numbers have an even number of factors (because factors come in distinct pairs)

For example:
* Bulb #16 factors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
* Factor pairs: (1,16), (2,8), (4,4)
* Since 4 pairs with itself, there are 5 factors (an odd number)

## Mathematical Formula for Factors of Perfect Squares

For a perfect square number n = k², where k is a positive integer:
* The number of factors is always 2n+1, where n is the number of distinct prime factors of k
* For example, 16 = 2⁴, has 1 distinct prime factor (2), so it has 2(1)+1 = 3 pairs of factors, or 5 total factors
* This is always an odd number, which is why perfect squares end up with an odd number of toggles

## Final Answer

For input n, the output will be all perfect squares less than or equal to n: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, etc.
